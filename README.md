# number-guesser

This was based on a project that the Udemy tutor walked us through step-by-step, however this was my independent attempt at it
without referring to his source code. I did this in order to practice without my 'stabiliser wheels' as such - to ensure I
wasn't just blindly following instructions and gaining no understanding.

As well as writing the code in my own way, I also added my own additional features to the project, such as custom warnings,
and simple aesthetic changes like changing the '1 guesses remaining' as seen in the tutors' code to change to '1 guess
remaining' once the final try is met. A small adjustment, but one I felt improved the app.
